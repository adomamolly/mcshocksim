# 🎲 Monte Carlo Shock Propagation Simulator

Monte Carlo simulation in Python modeling shock propagation and system-level risk.

Overview

This project uses Monte Carlo simulation to model how small random shocks propagate through an interconnected system over time. The goal is to study system stability, variance, and tail-risk behavior using simulation-based modeling techniques.
